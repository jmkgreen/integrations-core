  # For every instance, you need a `stats_url` and can optionally
  # supply a list of tags. The admin endpoint must be accessible.

  - stats_url: http://localhost:80/stats
  #   If the stats page is behind basic auth.

  #   tags:

  #   The (optional) disable_ssl_validation will instruct the check to
  #   skip the validation of the SSL certificate of the URL being tested.
  #   Defaults to false, set to true if you want to disable SSL certificate validation.
  #
  #   disable_ssl_validation: False

  #   The (optional) skip_proxy parameter will bypass any proxy
  #   settings enabled and attempt to reach the URL directly.
